# FIXR - Connecting Clients with Service Providers

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
**Fixr** is a web application that bridges the gap between clients and service providers, offering a convenient platform for finding and negotiating services. Whether you're looking for help with home improvement, tech support, or professional consultations, Fixr simplifies the process of connecting with service providers.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
## Features
