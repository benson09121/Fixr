# Fixr

A comprehensive home service platform connecting clients with local service providers across the Philippines. Fixr streamlines the process of finding, hiring, and receiving professional home services while empowering the informal sector by providing reliable opportunities for local workers.

## 📋 Project Summary

Fixr is a full-stack web application that bridges the gap between clients seeking home services and skilled service providers. The platform operates on a dual-user system where clients can easily locate and book professionals for various services (cleaning, repairs, wellness, etc.), while workers can register to offer their services and connect with potential clients. Built with a modern React frontend and PHP backend, Fixr features real-time location tracking, booking management, chat functionality, and an administrative dashboard for platform oversight.
